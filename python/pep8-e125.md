# Continuation line with same indent as next logical line (E125)

Continuation lines should not be indented at the same level as the next logical line. Instead, they should be indented to one more level so as to distinguish them from the next line.

## Concepts

### Anti-pattern

In this example the second line is indented at the same level as the line below it. This makes it difficult to tell what is in the if block and what is a part of the boolean expression.

```python
if user is not None and user.is_admin or \
    user.name == 'Grant':
    blah = 'yeahnah'
```

### Best practice

```python
if user is not None and user.is_admin or \
        user.name == 'Grant':
    blah = 'yeahnah'
```

---
One more common example we face is when a method has many parameters such that it crosses `max-line-length`:

### Anti-pattern

```python
def foo(arg_very_long_name_1, arg_very_long_name_2, arg_very_long_name_3, arg_very_long_name_4, arg_very_long_name_5, arg_very_long_name_6, arg_very_long_name_7, arg_very_long_name_8, arg_very_long_name_9, arg_very_long_name_10):
```

**Note**: Ideally we should avoid having too many function parameters. If we are in such situation, this means function can be broken into more smaller functions doing one specific job i.e try to write *pure functions*.

### Better practice

```python
def foo_method(arg_very_long_name_1, arg_very_long_name_2,
                arg_very_long_name_3, arg_very_long_name_4,
                arg_very_long_name_5, arg_very_long_name_6,
                arg_very_long_name_7, arg_very_long_name_8,
                arg_very_long_name_9, arg_very_long_name_10):
```

*Tip*: Line break is one-level indented below the first method parameter and so on.

Another common example:

```python
def foo_method(
        self,    # Add 4 spaces (an extra level of indentation) to distinguish arguments from the rest.
        arg1,
        arg2,
        arg2): # should close on this line to for avoiding E125 (continuation line with same indent as next logical line).
```
