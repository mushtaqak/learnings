# Podman

## Introduction

[Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/) is a very good alternative to Docker. Podman is free to use, it is faster.

## Installation

- Download `Podman Desktop` from https://podman-desktop.io/
- Alterntively, you can install via Homebrew: `brew install --cask podman-desktop`

## Commands

- Podman uses same commands as docker. Which means we can use `docker-compose` commands as well.
- Please see [docker commands](./docker.md) to get the idea of the commands.

## Tip

- You can alias podman with docker, by addin `alias docker=podman` in your `~/zshrc` file.
